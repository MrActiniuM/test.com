       <h2>Hi, and welcome! I am Zebulun, and I would like to list down my travels on this website!</h2>

       <p>This is just some of my trips in 2024. </p>
              
           <h2>Enjoy!</h2>

           <h1>3 February 2024: Warrah Lookout, Mt. Ettalong, Ettalong Beach</h1>
           <hr>
           <h2>Wakeup</h2>
           <p>So, it was the early morning of 3 February, my birthday!</p>
           <p>I expected my father to be at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AVIS&rlz=1C1GCEA_enAU1108AU1108&oq=AVIS&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTINCAEQABiDARixAxiABDINCAIQABiDARixAxiABDINCAMQABiDARixAxiABDIQCAQQABiDARixAxiABBiKBTINCAUQABiDARixAxiABDINCAYQABiDARixAxiABDINCAcQABiDARixAxiABDIHCAgQABiABDINCAkQABiDARixAxiABNIBCDEyMThqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&{google:instantExtendedEnabledParameter}ie=UTF-8">AVIS</a> to be renting a car.</p>
           <p>And I was right! My father was nowhere to be seen, and his possessions were also nowhere to be seen. He <strong>must</strong> be at AVIS, I thought. My family had breakfast, and almost immediately after we finished, we heard a knock on the door. It was my father, and the car he rented was a Hybrid Toyota Corolla.</p>
           <p>At this time, I had a weird habit of listing our rented cars by their plate numbers. This Corolla had a plate number of <b>2I3.FT3</b>.</p>'
           <br>
           <h2>Travel Time!</h2>
           <p>Now, we packed our bags and packed our supplies. Then, we went to <strong>2I3.FT3</strong>.</p>
           <p>It was a very nice car, but the big problem was it didn't have a USB port to attach our hard disk drive (HDD). So we just sucked it up and used Bluetooth to connect music with my father's phone.</p>
           <p>Now, we were firstly bound for Lidcombe Shopping Centre, to pick up my birthday cake at Breadtop. Only my father entered the store, and My mother, brother and I stayed in <strong>2I3.FT3</strong>.</p>
           <p>After ordering the cake, we drove off to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Motorway_(Sydney%E2%80%93Newcastle)">M1 Pacific Motorway</a>, bound for the lookout near Patonga, Warrah Lookout.</p>
           <h2>Exiting the M1</h2>
           <br>
           <p>Just after we crossed the oddly-named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooney_Mooney_Creek">Mooney Mooney Creek</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooney_Mooney_Bridge">Mooney Mooney Bridge</a>, we took the ramp off the M1 to enter the <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Highway">A49 Central Coast Highway</a>. Finally, it was a big relief to get out of the noisy highway ambience, and in a few minutes, we turned on Woy Woy Road, headed for obviously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woy_Woy">Woy Woy</a>!</p>
        <p>After traversing along Woy Woy Road for several kilometres, we bypassed Mt. Ettalong</p>

        <h1>30 and 31 March 2024: Royal Nat'l Park, Kurnell, Cape Solander, Pine Crest Orchard, Mt Banks, Hargraves Lookout, Three Sisters</h1>
          <hr>
          <h2>Wakeup</h2>
          <p>So, I woke up pretty surprised because the day before, my father said I can join him again to pick up the rented car, but he left me back at home!</p>
          <p>Eventually, my father came back just after brekfast, and I decided to smuggle along my old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S6">Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge</a> finally, to film and photo some media.</p>
          <h2>Travel Time!</h2>
          <p>When we went to our garage, the car was another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Corolla">Toyota Corolla</a> with a plate number of <strong>CY.80.VI</strong>.</p>
          <p>Below is a video of <strong>CY.80.VI</strong> and Royal Nat'l Park.</p>

          <p>And KABOOM we went! We traversed toward Royal Nat'l Park and went through a series of roads.</p>
          <p>However, when we were on the road called Bangor Bypass, I broke out my phone and started filming! The videos I took is attached below.</p>

          <p>As shown in the final video, <strong>CY.80.VI</strong> was approaching the Royal National Park.</p>
          <p>That was until my father realized something really devastating. We forgot to order KFC!!!!!!</p>
          <p>It was a serious problem, because the closest KFC was apptoximately 2km from our location at RNP. We just decided to stop real quick to go Number 1, at the small picninc area. The video of us at the picnic area is attached a few lines up.</p>

          <p>After our brek, we decided to drive over to the KFC at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda,_New_South_Wales">Miranda</a>.</p>
          <p> After a few minutes we finally reached the Miranda KFC where we ordered a Zinger Box, Wicked Wings and a Double Choc Mousse.</p>

          <p>After stopping near a random street at Miranda to eat the scrumpdiddlyumtious fried chicken, My family decided to go over to Kurnell.</p>

          <p>After paying $8 at the entrance to Kamay Botany Bay Nat'l Park, we headed over to Commemoration Flat Picnic Area, and recorded a lot of videos. Here they are! (It's a truckload!!)</p>
